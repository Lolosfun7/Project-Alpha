# ETF Performance Comparison Project

## Overview
This project involves comparing the performance of different ETFs over a specific time frame. We've developed a Python script that fetches historical data from Yahoo Finance, normalizes it for comparison, and visualizes the data in a plot. This tool is particularly useful for investors or students interested in financial markets analysis.

### Examples of Appliction
Example: Simple ETF Performance Comparison
Application Example:  
ETFs Compared: SPY (S&P 500), QQQ (Nasdaq-100), and IWM (Russell 2000).
Time Frame: January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020.

Results:
SPY: Increased by 16.3%
QQQ: Increased by 43.6%
IWM: Increased by 19.5%

Analysis Summary:During 2020, technology-focused ETFs like QQQ significantly outperformed broader market ETFs like SPY, likely due to the tech sector's resilience and growth amidst remote work trends.
