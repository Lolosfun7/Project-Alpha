# ETF Performance Comparison Project

## Overview
This project involves comparing the performance of different ETFs over a specific time frame. We've developed a Python script that fetches historical data from Yahoo Finance, normalizes it for comparison, and visualizes the data in a plot. This tool is particularly useful for investors or students interested in financial markets analysis.
